Analysis of Interaction of Different Cell-types in Human Cancer Tissue Architecture

Overview

There is a growing body of compelling evidence in biomedical research that the cellular composition of human tissue plays a major role in health and disease. The type of cells infiltrating the tissue microenvironment from blood circulation dictates the tissue status. Human cancer tissue is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory immune cells and unstimulated suppressive immune cells.

This project analyzes the interaction of various cell types in human cancer tissues, specifically examining their spatial effects. The primary objective is to study the spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in four types of cancer tissues: colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer.

Data

The data used for this project is generated by the Imaging Mass Cytometry technique, which captures information about the expression of 40 proteins in a specific region of interest on tissue slides. The dataset is contained in an R object of the class "SpatialExperiment," comprising 46,917 individual cells.
